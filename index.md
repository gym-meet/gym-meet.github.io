## Overview

### The Problem
For many university students, their first introduction to the gym is the Rec Center. They want to be more active but are too intimidated to go to the gym alone. They are discouraged by their lack of experience and knowledge of the machines, and fear making mistakes and injuring themselves. To overcome this, they opt to invite their friends to come along with them. But oftentimes, their schedules donâ€™t match up, which deters them from going.

### Our Solution
Our gym-meet app allows students to connect with others according to their schedules and workout preferences, and go to the gym together. With this, UH students can get to know people with similar interests and experience levels, and not be afraid of going to the gym alone.

### Milestone 1: Mockup development

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system.

Milestone 1 was managed using [BowFolio GitHub Project Board M1](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/projects/1):
